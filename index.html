    <p> Growing and better connecting the seller and buyer communities is critical to the success of the Etsy marketplace. In this study, I focus specifically on the sellers – their characteristics, behaviors and experiences - in order to form strategies that will enhance the success of their shops and better connect them with customers.  This study represents an outline for my analysis. <br/>(I would love the opportunity to carry out this analysis on real data!) </p>
    </nav>
    <article>
    <h2 class="styled">Step 1: Lay the Foundation <br/> (Study Sellers and Their Shops)</h2>
    <p>Objective: Study sellers, their shops and general product trends in order to build a foundation in which to form deeper analysis. Below I've outlined three areas of study - seller characterstics, engagement, and sales and satisfaction, with associated metrics for each. (Note that "time period" can mean weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on metric).</p>
    <h3>Characteristic Trends</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Total sellers/time period</li>
      <li>Distribution of sellers by geography</li>
      <li>Distribution of sellers by product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of sellers by length of shop ownership</li>
      <li>New sellers/time period</li>
      <li>Retention rate of new sellers/time period</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Engagement Trends</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Average time spent in shop by sellers/time period</li>

      <li>Distribution of number of product listings</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Average product listings per shop by product category</li>
        </ul>
      <li>App engagement frequency</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Percentage of shop owners who use app</li>
          <li>Frequency of app visits per shop owner</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sales and Satisfaction Trends</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Average views: sales ratio per shop/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average # sales/time period/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average yearly revenue/shop/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average # coupons used per shop/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average # of unfulfilled orders/shop/product category</li>
      <li>Number of sales to new customers/time period/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of shop ratings/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average # of "Favorites" per product/shop/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of # reviews/shop/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of # "support touches" from sellers/time period</li>
      <li>Etsy Seller Success Newsletter subscriptions/time period</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="styled">Step 2: Build the Support Beams<br/>(Form Hypotheses to Test)</h2>
    <p>Depending on the results from the first level of analysis above, begin to form some hypotheses to test further areas of investigation. As a place to start, consider: What might make a high-performing shop? What might make a 'good' seller? There are several different success metrics we can define. For Etsy sellers, success may be found in quantity of sales, revenue generated, and store ratings. For the Etsy marketplace itself, success may also be found in sellers' ability to bring in new Etsy customers (new customer aquisition) and connect them with the marketplace (traffic to other sellers' shops). Even though there are many ways to define performance success, this step is all about exploring relationships. As an analyst, I'm curious about the following: </p>
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Do shops that sell a greater number of products tend to make more sales?</li>
      <li>Do shops that have been around a longer time tend to make more sales?</li> 
      <li>Do shops that have lower views to sales ratios tend to make more sales? How does the views to sales ratio change over the shop's lifetime? What might be causing lower views to sales ratios for these shops?</li>
      <li>Do shops that regularly bring in new customers make more sales? Or do the shops with loyal customer bases tend to make more sales?</li>
      <li>Do shops that offer discount coupons experience an increase in sales? </li> 
      <li>Do shops that sell products from a variety of product categories tend to sell more products/bring in more revenue?</li>
      <li>Do the high sales/high revenue shops tend to engage more with the app? Spend more time setting up their shops? Have more “favored” products?</li>
      <li>Do the shops with more customer reviews listed tend to make more sales?</li> 
      <li>The sellers that end up closing their shops – what are their views to sales ratios in the first month? Quarter? Year? Do these sellers tend to offer fewer products? Are there some behavior or sales patterns among these shops?</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p> Whew! While this list is extensive, there are still tons more questions we could explore. I've tried to hone in on questions that might help shop owners better position their shops for success.

    <h2 class="styled">Step 3: Use Our Tools (Test Our Hypotheses)</h2>
    <img class="aligned" src="http://i.imgur.com/GUEovu1.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
    <p>To test these questions, let’s reach back into our toolbox to use some predictive modeling techniques. R is going to be an extremely useful tool for this step – here’s a <a class="styled" href="https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/"> link </a> to download; it’s free!</p>
    <br/>
    <p> First we could run some simple linear regressions (single-variable). Our independent variable could be sales, and our dependent variable could be any number of measures – store lifetime, number of products sold, whether coupons are offered, etc. 
    Once we explore the statistically significant correlations between the variables above, we can dive deeper into building a predictive model for shop success.</p>
    <br/>
    <p> Here’s where multivariate regression modeling can come in handy! Say our sample SHOPDATASET (csv file) contains the following columns. 
    <ul>
        <li>Shop id (shop_id)</li>
        <li>2015 sales, in $ (sales)</li>
        <li>2015 number of products sold (no_prod)</li>
        <li>Store lifetime, in months (lifetime)</li>
        <li>2015 Average views to sales ratio (vts_ratio)</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>Pretend that in the simple linear regressions above, we found correlations that are statistically significant (with a p value <= 0.05) between sales and lifetime, sales and no_product, and sales and vts_ratio. We might want to run the following regression in R:</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="equation">lm(sales ~ lifetime + no_prod + vts_ratio, shopdataset)</p>
    <br/>
    <p>We are curious about the coefficients (c1, c2, c3) of the output equation:</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="equation">sales = c1(lifetime) + c2(no_prod) + c3(vts_ratio) + a</p>
    </br>
    <p>where a is our y-intercept.</p>
    </br>
    <p>For example, if we found that the value of c2 = 600, then our model says that for each increase in the number of products sold by a shop, there is an expected increase in yearly shop sales of $600.</p>

    <h2 class="styled">Step 4: Build our Walls (Form Practical Strategies)</h2>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/0Voymaz.jpg" style="width:250px;height:200px;">
    <p>Here is where we build the walls and raise the roof of our awesome analysis!<p>
    <br/>
    <p>This step allows us to translate our findings into practical knowledge for Etsy sellers, allowing them to improve their shops and strengthen the Etsy marketplace as a whole. The real question at the heart of this analysis is: How can we study the growth trajectory of the shops themselves to help new sellers through growing pains? Further, how can we lead sellers to shop success? Below I’ve outlined three areas in which these findings might translate into practical solutions. <p/>
    <ol>
        <li>Strengthening the performance of all sellers: Can we somehow put these findings into a training guide for Etsy sellers?</li><p>
            <ul>
                <li>Say we discovered from our analysis that the more variety of product categories sold within a shop, the greater the sales of those products tends to be. Or that many of the sellers who end up closing their shops generally have a lower number of product reviews. We could strongly recommend to new sellers that they try to sell products from a vareity of product categories, as well as actively ask customers to write reviews. Etsy could hold webinars and training sessions around these findings and regularly engage sellers with "shop best practices" to help them navigate shop growth.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>Identifying and improving low-performing sellers: Could we build a predictive model with this data that might tell a seller how their shop is performing in real-time, and identify areas for improvement? </li><p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perhaps this is some sort of rating system from 0 to 100 (based on variables like store lifetime, number of products sold, site visits, favorites, feedback), where each seller gets a score in real time that compares their shop's performance against top-performing shops with similar shop lifetimes, product categories, and target customers. </li>
                <li>The ratings system could also encourage sellers in areas where they are underperforming - say, for example, in number of site visits - by providing targeted strategy recommendations to increase these numbers. The ratings systems could also help Etsy recommend strategies to lead sellers through different growth stages of their shops. </li>
                <li>The rating system would only be visible to sellers on their "shop stats" page. </li>
            </ul>
        <br/>
        <li> Recognizing high-performing sellers: Could Etsy develop a rewards program for outstanding shop owners? To encourage/incentivize/highlight seller behavior that leads to success? </li></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maybe this looks like membership into a special designated "Gold Star" seller group, one that invites sellers to special  webinars, trainings, or even conferences throughout the year. </li>
                <li>Perhaps top-performing sellers could be featured on the Etsy blog, with their strategies highlighted so that other sellers can learn from their success. </li>
            </ul>

      <h2 class="styled">Conclusion: Bringing Data to Design</h2>
      <p>In this analysis, we recognize that studying Etsy sellers, their behaviors, preferences, and the associated performance of their shops not only informs strategies to help sellers grow their shops, but also is critical to strengthening the Etsy marketplace as a whole. A strong seller base will lead to a strong buyer community. Using data insights to constantly inform the design of the Etsy marketplace to better foster human connection among sellers and buyers will be essential to growing and evolving the marketplace into the future.</p>
