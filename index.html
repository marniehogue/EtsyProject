    <p> Growing and better connecting the seller and buyer communities is critical to the success of the Etsy marketplace. In this study, I focus specifically on the sellers – their characteristics, behaviors and experiences - in order to form strategies that will enhance the success of their shops and better connect them with customers.  This study represents an outline for analysis of seller data. <br/>(I would love the opportunity to carry out this analysis on real data!) </p>

    <h2 class="styled">Step 1: Lay the Foundation <br/> (Study Sellers and Their Shops)</h2>
    <p>Objective: Study sellers, their shops and general trends in order to have a foundation in which to form deeper analysis. Below I've outlined three areas of study - seller characterstics, engagement, and sales and satisfaction, with associated metrics for each. (Note that "time period" can mean weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on metric).</p>

      <li>Total sellers/time period</li>
      <li>Distribution of sellers by geography</li>
      <li>Distribution of sellers by product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of sellers by length of shop ownership</li>
      <li>New sellers/time period</li>
      <li>Retention rate of new sellers/time period</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Engagement Trends</h3>
    <ul>

    <h3>Sales and Satisfaction Trends</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Average views: sales ratio per shop/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average # sales/time period/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average yearly revenue/shop/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average # coupons used per shop/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average number of unfulfilled orders/shop/product category</li>
      <li>Number of sales to new customers/time period/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of shop ratings/product category</li>
      <li>Distribution of average # of "Favorites" per product/shop/product category</li>

    <h2 class="styled">Step 2: Build the Support Beams<br/>(Form Hypotheses to Test)</h2>
    <p>Depending on the results from the first level of analysis above, begin to form some hypotheses to test further areas of investigation. As a place to start, consider: What might make a high-performing shop? What might make a 'good' seller? There are several different success metrics we can define. For Etsy sellers, success may be found in quantity of sales, revenue generated, and store ratings. For the Etsy marketplace itself, success may also be found in sellers' ability to bring in new customers (new customer aquisition) and connect them with the marketplace (traffic to other sellers' shops). Even though there are many ways to define performance success, this step is all about exploring relationships. As an analyst, I'm curious about the following questions: </p>
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Do shops that sell a greater number of products tend to make more sales?</li>
      <li>Do shops that have been around a longer time tend to make more sales?</li> 
      <li>Do shops that have lower views to sales ratios tend to make more sales? How does the views to sales ratio change over the shop's lifetime? What might be causing lower views to sales ratios for these shops?</li>
      <li>Do shops that regularly bring in new customers make more sales? Or do the shops with loyal customer bases tend to make more sales?</li>
      <li>Do shops that offer discount coupons experience an increase in sales? </li> 
      <li>Do shops that sell products from a variety of product categories tend to sell more products/bring in more revenue?</li>
      <li>Do the high sales/high revenue shops tend to engage more with the app? Spend more time setting up their shops? Have more “favored” products?</li>
      <li>Do the shops with more more customer reviews listed tend to make more sales?</li> 
      <li>The sellers that end up closing their shops – what are their views to sales ratios in the first month? Quarter? Year? Do these sellers tend to offer less products? Are there some behavior or sales patterns among these shops?</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p> Whew! While this list is exhaustive, there are still tons more questions we could explore. I've tried to hone in on questions that might help shop owners better position their shops for success.

    <h2 class="styled">Step 3: Use Our Tools (Test Our Hypotheses)</h2>
    <p>To test these questions, let’s reach back into our toolbox to use some predictive modeling techniques. R is going to be extremely useful for this step – here’s a <a class="styled" href="https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/"> link </a> to download, it’s free!</p>
    <br/>
    <p> First we could run some simple linear regressions (single-variable). Our independent variable could be sales, and our dependent variable could be any number of measures – store lifetime, number of products sold, whether coupons are offered, etc. 
    Once we explore the statistically significant correlations between the variables above, we can dive deeper into building a predictive model for shop success.</p>
    <br/>
    <p> Here’s where multivariate regression modeling can come in handy! Say our sample SHOPDATASET (csv file) contains the following columns. 
    <ul>
        <li>Shop id (shop_id)</li>
        <li>2015 sales, in $ (sales)</li>
        <li>2015 number of products sold (no_prod)</li>
        <li>Store lifetime, in months (lifetime)</li>
        <li>2015 Average views to sales ratio (vts_ratio)</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>Pretend that in the simple linear regressions above, we found correlations that are statistically significant (with a p value < 0.5) between sales and lifetime, sales and no_product, and sales and vts_ratio. We might want to run the following in R:</p>
    <br/>
    <p>lm(sales ~ lifetime + no_prod + vts_ratio, shopdataset)</p>
    <br/>
    <p>We are curious about the coefficients of the output equation:</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Sales = c1(lifetime) + c2(no_prod) + c3(vts_ratio) + a, where a is our y-intercept.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>For example, if we found that the value of c2 = 600, then we can say that for each increase in the number of products sold by a shop, there is an expected increase in yearly shop sales of $600.</p>

    <h2 class="styled">Step 4: Build our Shop Walls<br/>(Form Practical Strategies for Shop Owners)</h2>
    <p>Here is where we build the walls and raise the roof of our awesome analysis!<p>
    <br/>
    <p>This step allows us to translate our findings into practical knowledge for Etsy sellers, allowing them to improve their shops and strengthen the Etsy marketplace as a whole. The real question at the heart of this analysis is: How can we study the growth trajectory of the shops themselves to help new sellers through growing pains? How can we lead sellers to shop success? Below I’ve outlined three areas in which these findings might translate into practical solutions. <p/>
    <ol>
        <li>Strengthening all sellers: Can we somehow put these findings into a training guide for Etsy sellers?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Say a major finding was that the more variety of products sold on a shop, the greater sales tends to be. Or that many of the sellers who ended up closing their shops generally had a lower number of reviews. We could strongly recommend to new sellers that they actively ask customers to write reviews, sell products from a variety of product categories. Etsy could hold webinars and training sessions around these findings. (make sure I reference existing ones, if there are any). </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>Identifying and improving low-performing sellers: Could we build a predictive model with this data that might tell a seller how their shop is performing in real-time, and identify areas for improvement? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Perhaps this is some sort of rating system from 0 to 100 (based on variables like store lifetime, number of products sold, site visits, favorites, feedback), where each seller gets a constantly-updating score that benchmarks them against top-performing sellers with similar lifetimes, product categories, and target customers. </li>
                <li>The ratings system could also encourage sellers through difference growth stages and recommend strategies to maximize on opportunities for growth – during the first month, six-months, etc. </li>
                <li>The rating system would only be visible to sellers could see on their profile page. (Insert Screen shot). </li>
            </ul>
        <br/>
        <li> Recognizing high-performing sellers: Could Etsy develop a rewards program for outstanding shop owners? To encourage/incentivize/highlight seller behavior that leads to success? </li></p>
